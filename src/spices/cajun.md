## Cajun seasoning
#### stolen from [Gimme Some Oven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/cajun-seasoning/) but modded by us

Equal parts:
* paprika (smoked)
* kosher salt
* garlic powder
* ground black pepper
* ground white pepper
* onion powder
* dried oregano
* thyme

plus some
* cayenne _(but a lot less so my young friend will eat it)_

Throw it all in a jar and shake. 

Consider using less salt so that you can salt as desired without accounting for the Cajun Seasoning.
