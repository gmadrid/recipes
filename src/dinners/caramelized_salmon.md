### Ingredients

* 1/2lb of salmon
* Ground pepper

---

### Recipe

Sprinkle black pepper on fish pieces. Add fish sauce and sugar. Set aside.

Heat 1T of oil. Add garlic, two thirds of shallots, stir and add the pork fat. Stir briefly and add the fish slices. Rotate fish to coat with fat, about 3 minutes. Add remaining sauce and sugar from the bowl, then add the molasses. Turn heat down to low and simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes.

Serve over rice with _lots_ of sauce.

### Notes

__Caramelized sugar__: I use molasses because I like the taste and it's easy. You can also use caramelized sugar. Mix 1/2C sugar with 3/4C water and 1t lemon juice. Cook on high until it's a nice rich brown color. Watch it like a hawk, because it will burn quickly.

__Fried shallots__: I normally sprinkle some store-bought fried shallots unto the final dish, but if you can make them fresh it's _so_ much better. Throw some sliced shallots into some fat and cook until crispy.

__Doubling__: When doubling the recipe, use 1.5lb of salmon. A strict doubling yields too much sauce.
