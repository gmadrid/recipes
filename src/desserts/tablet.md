## Scottish Butter Tablet

### Ingredients

* 900g sugar (prefer superfine, but granulated will work)
* 250ml whole milk (2% seems fine, too)
* 1 stick butter, cubed
* 1 14oz can of condensed milk

--- 

### Recipe

Prep: line a 9x12" sheet pan with parchment.

1. In a large pot, melt sugar in milk being careful not to burn. Stir frequently
   until all sugar is dissolved. 

2. When the sugar is dissolved, throw the cubed butter into the pot. Wait for
   it to melt.

3. Once the butter is melted, add the condensed milk and mix. Keep stirring until
   the syrup reaches 250F. 

4. Once it's reached 250F, take the syrup off the heat and begin to stir
   vigorously. It will thicken and get slightly grainy-looking. At this point,
   you can add a pinch of salt, some vanilla, some whiskey, or whatever you 
   want to experiment with.

5. Pour into the lined tin smoothing it into all the corners. Give it 30 minutes
   to cool, and then cut if desired. Leave to cool for a couple of hours or
   overnight. 

Store this in an airtight container, or it will go slushy.

### Notes 

We do this in a large pot because the boiling syrup will climb the sides of the
pan a little. I think that if you're stirring, this won't be as bad. (I didn't
have any problems with it.)

I used granulated sugar, and it took forever to dissolve. I got it to 200F before I
was ready to add the butter. Using superfine might make this faster, but I don't
think it affected the quality of the final product.

I started this in the microwave, but I don't think that's necessary as long
as you're careful and you stir a _lot_. In fact, I was extremely cautious with
the stove heat. I think I could have gone faster as long as I was careful and 
kept stirring.

When the syrup has reached 250, the color will have chaged to the "tablet color."
Absent a candy thermometer, you could use this to gauge doneness which I'm sure
is what countless Scottish grans have been doing forever.

___Next time___, I want to try salted vanilla.
