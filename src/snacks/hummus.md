Combine lemon and tahini in food pro. Zip for about 1 min,
scrape the sides, zip for another 30 seconds to whip the base.

Add olive oil, garlic, cumin, some salt.
Buzz for 30 secs, scrape, 30 more secs.

Drain and rinse the chickpeas, saving the aquafaba.
Add half of chickpeas and buzz 1 min, scrape sides,
add the rest of the chickpeas,
then process until thick and smooth, about 1-2 mins.

Adjust consistency with reserved aquafaba (probably 2-3T).

Adjust salt.

Serve with sprinkled paprika, drizzle of olive oil.

### NOTES

The flavor of the garlic and cumin didn't quite come through. Try adding
a little more next time.

Try with roasted red peppers (maybe some jalapeno or other hot pepper).
