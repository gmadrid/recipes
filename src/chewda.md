## Chewda recipe


### Spice mixes

I find it helpful to measure out all of the spice mixes before starting. You can cut some time off the process by doing this while the rice is roasting/frying, but just don't burn the rice.

All of the spices measurements should be thought of as being 'heaping' - I am quite generous (but not humorously generous) with the spices. The sole exception to this is the salt - it is easy to over-salt.

#### Fry spices
```
• 1t turmeric
• 1t chili powder
```

#### Peanut spices
```
• 1t table salt
• 1/4t turmeric
• 1/2t chili powder
```

#### Nut spices
```
• 1 1T sugar
• 1t ground cumin
• 1/2t cumin seeds
• 1t ground coriander
• 1/2t hing
• 1t table salt
```

#### Phodney
```
• 1 1/2t black mustard seeds
• 1t ground cumin
• 1/4C sesame seeds
• 1/2C (or more) curry leaves
• 1/2t turmeric
```

### Recipe
```
• 5C flat rice
```

_Everything_ happens in the same big pan.

Dry roast the flat rice until it curls. It should be crispy
when you bite it. If it's not crispy, roast it some more. When done,
dump it all into a large bowl.

```
• 2T oil
• Fry spices (above)
• 10C puffed rice
```
Heat the oil. When hot, add the Fry spices. When they have stopped foaming (and they smell real good), add the puffed rice. Immediately, stir it all up, constantly moving rice from the bottom of the pan to the top. Eventually, everything will be a (mostly) uniform shade of yellow/orange.

When the puffed rice is crispy, dump it on top of the flat rice in the big bowl.

```
• 1/2C oil
• 1C raw peanuts (get them skinless if you can, but if not, it's no big deal)
• Peanut spices (above)
```
_(See the NOTE in the next section.)_

Add the oil to the pot.

Fry the peanuts in the oil. They should go from whitish to light brown. (Dark brown spots are okay. Dark brown peanuts are burned.)

Remove the peanuts from the pan with a slotted spoon and add to the bowl. Sprinkle the Peanut spices on the hot peanuts.

```
• 1C cashews
• 1/2C split dry roasted chick peas
• 1/4C thin sliced (maybe chopped) coconut
• Nut spices (above)
```
_NOTE_: Since I cannot eat the cashews, I add 50% more to each of the peanuts, chickpeas and coconut.

Fry the cashews on very low heat. Be careful; they are easy to burn. When done, remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and add to the bowl on top of the peanuts. You want a large surface area of nuts, because you will be sprinkling spices on them.

Fry the chick peas in the oil over medium heat. When they are done, remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and add to the bowl on top of the cashews. Large surface area.

Fry the coconut. Be careful, it burns easy. When done, remove from oil with a slotted spoon and spread on top of the nuts/chickpeas.

When all of that stuff is done cooking and in the bowl, pour the Nut spices on the hot nuts. (Personally, I add a little of the spices to each ingredient after it cooks, portioning it out appropriately. The spices stick a little better if you add them while the nuts are still hot.)

```
• 4 (or more) big green chilis cut into 1cm sections
• Phodney (above)
```
_In the same oil_, fry the chili pieces, squishing them as they cook. This squeezes out all of the nice chili flavor into the oil where it will flavor everything else in the phodney.  

_Optional:_ Personally, I find that the chilis are never crispy, so after they have cooked and given their goodness, I'm beginning to just take them out.

Add the rest of the phodney ingredients to the oil and fry until the curry leaves are crispy.

Pour the phodney over the pile of everything else. Stir everything together until the chewda is mostly homogenous. Do this while everything is hot, because I think it helps mix the yummy oil into the rest of the mix better.

Eat, yum.
