## Best Basic Margarita
#### Somewhere between Regan and Degroff

* 1.5oz Reposado Tequila
* 1oz Cointreau
* .75oz Lime juice

Combine all ingredients and shake with ice. Pour into a coupe (or cocktail) glass
with a salted rim.

This margarita is not intended to be served over ice. 

This is the basic 3-2-1 New Orleans Sour with a little extra lime juice, 
because we like it. Feel free to experiment from here.

You can also add spice to the salt rim to create some interest. (Ground cumin, 
chili powder, lime zest.... You get the idea.)
