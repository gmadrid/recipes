## The Boston Cardshark
#### _Stolen_ from Tony Cabral

* 1 ½ oz bourbon (Buffalo Trace if you can, Eagle Rare or Knob Creek if you must)
* 1 oz Campari
* 1 perfect oz Vermouth (½ dry, ½ sweet)

Swirl it in a shaker, pour it over a big-ass ice cube. 

As far as I know, the “perfect Boulevardier” doesn’t have a name, 
so I gave it one. Stay thirsty, friends.

(Tony also suggests using port instead of sweet vermouth. The Portuguese Cardshark.)
