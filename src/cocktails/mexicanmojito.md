## Mexican Mojito

* 4 lime wedges
* 2 1/2 bar spoons granulated sugar
* 8-10 fresh mint leaves
* 2 1/2 oz Sauza silver
* soda water
* mint sprig garnish

Muddle the lime, sugar, mint leaves in a mixing glass.  
Add ice, run. Shake and strain into a collins/highball glass.  
Top with soda.  
Garnish with a sprig of mint.

#### NOTE

I usually make this for two people which makes the 2 1/2 spoons of sugar 
less ridiculous.
